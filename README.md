Overview

The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage a library's operations more effectively. It is an interactive portal meant to automate all processes and provide excellent user experience. It is intended to overcome the restrictiveness, or lack thereof of brick-and-mortar institutions, providing boundless access to a wider reading audience. This system is purely online and as such the features will reflect the desire of this project to meaningfully impact its community of users. The target user is anyone intent on learning, especially those who by circumstance are or may find themselves in book deserts.
